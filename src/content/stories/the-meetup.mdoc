## ACT1: The Meetup

She stood there staring at his lifeless body as he bled out, the red blood staining the white tiles as it spread. The clink from the drop of the knife jolted her back to life. She had just killed a man. Not just any man, her ex. How did she end up here? Maybe she had taken the line I might kill my ex from SZA’s song too seriously. A lot was going through her mind at that moment, but one thing was clear, Oyin had seen way too many crime documentaries to know the first step was to hide the murder weapon. With shaky hands, she picked up the knife from where it lay near Mike’s feet, wrapped it in a scarf, and stuffed it inside her bag. Next was getting rid of the body. This was the hardest part because she wasn’t at her own place. She was in Mike’s apartment. And the new gateman had seen her come in. The day had started so well. Oyin had woken up feeling lighter than she had in years. Butterflies fluttered wildly in her stomach as she stretched, her heart racing with excitement. Today was the day. After two years of longing, of stalking his social media from a fake account, of replaying every mistake she made in their relationship, she was finally going to see Mike again. And not just by accident, He had asked her to come. two years of her regretting letting the best thing in her life go, Mike was literally the only person she had in her life that wasn’t paid to hang out with her and kiss her ass, They met right after her foster parents passed in an accident and she moved to live with her foster mom’s sister who had gotten attached to her and couldn’t bear the thought of letting her go, Mike lived in the next compound and they attended the same school even though he was 2 years ahead of her and in his final year , they became really close friends and started dating right after he gained admission into the university of Lagos. The relationship lasted 12 years after that and within that period, Oyin and Mike had grown to be friends and fate shined brightly on them as the both became really successful, Oyin had joined one of the biggest law firms in Lagos, Bode and Kola chambers as one of the best lawyers they have while also running her own fashion brand Óyín which all Lagos influencers and celebrities were wearing and Mike was working in tech for a company in Los Angeles so he always worked from home, the relationship was going well until Oyin got too busy with work and Mike feeling ignored brought up lots of fight which ended up in her deciding it has better to let him go before he wakes up one day and realize he hates her. A random encounter at the supermarket had reignited something between them. At first, it was casual. Texting here and there. But then, two nights ago, after one too many glasses of wine, she had called him. A drunk, messy call where she cried and told him she still loved him. To her surprise, he didn’t shut her down. Instead, he admitted he missed her too. That he never really moved on. That they should talk. Properly. So here she was, getting ready like it was the first date all over again. She took her time picking out an outfit something effortlessly stunning, something that would remind him of what he lost. She stopped by her store, grabbed a few things, and by the time she got into her car, she was practically vibrating with excitement. Everything was going to be perfect. But the first hitch came when she got to his apartment. The gateman she knew, the one who used to let her in with a nod and a smile, was gone. Instead, a new guy stood at the gate, eyeing her suspiciously. “Who you say you dey find?” “Mike,” she said, already reaching for her phone. “I’m his” she paused, realizing she wasn’t sure what to call herself anymore. “E no tell me say anybody dey come,” the gateman said, arms crossed. Oyin sighed, dialing Mike’s number. He picked up on the second ring. “I’m outside,” she said, trying to keep the frustration out of her voice. A few moments later, the gateman got the call. His expression remained stiff, but he unlocked the gate and stepped aside. “Oga say make you enter.” She walked in, feeling slightly uneasy. She wasn’t here to do anything wrong. She was here to fix things. To get her man back. And when she finally stepped into the apartment and saw Mike standing there, looking at her the way he used to, everything else faded away. “Oyinkansola,” he said in a sing song tone, stepping forward to embrace her. The hug felt like home again. Safe. Familiar. Like she was right where she belonged. She wanted to stay there forever, wrapped in the warmth of him, inhaling the scent she had memorized years ago. But reality pulled her back when the hug lingered a little too long just past the point of comfortable. She finally stepped back, clearing her throat. “Your gateman is really annoying,” she said, rolling her eyes. Mike chuckled, shoving his hands into his pockets. “Yeah, he takes his job a little too seriously. You should’ve just told him you were my wife.” Oyin felt her stomach flip, but she masked it with a smirk. “Oh? Would that have worked?” Mike’s gaze held hers for a second longer than necessary. “Maybe.” Her heart pounded. Maybe this was really happening. Maybe they were really getting another chance. Maybe She knew the day was going to be a good day. She could feel it deep in her stomach. Maybe it was just the butterflies, or maybe it was something more something telling her that today, after everything, things were finally falling back into place. Then they sat down. She glanced around the apartment, taking in the changes. The couch was new, the shelves rearranged, but one thing remained the same. Her eyes landed on the art piece she had bought for the living room years ago. It was still there, hanging in its original spot like it had never left. A small smile tugged at her lips as she pointed at it. “Some things are just too good to put away.” Mike followed her gaze, then looked back at her with a smirk. “Guess I have a thing for keeping good stuff around.” Something about the way he said it made her stomach flip, but she brushed it off, letting the conversation flow. They sat opposite each other, laughing, reminiscing, talking like no time had passed. But there was still a space between them a gap neither of them had crossed yet. Until Mike tapped the seat beside him. “Come sit here,” he said. She hesitated for half a second before moving closer, her heart hammering as she settled next to him. Almost instinctively, she leaned in and hugged him, her body remembering the way it used to fit against his. He exhaled against her shoulder. “I missed you, Oyin.” She pulled back slightly, looking into his eyes. “I know.” A beat of silence passed before he asked, “Do you still smoke?” She chuckled. “Some things never change.” Mike reached into the drawer and pulled out a pre-rolled joint, lighting it effortlessly like muscle memory. He took a slow drag, then passed it to her. The moment felt so familiar, yet different. Like slipping into an old life but seeing it with new eyes. They sat there, close, letting the silence stretch between them, thick with unspoken words and unsaid feelings. As they passed the joint back and forth, the conversation drifted. “So how’s life been?” Mike asked, his voice smooth, relaxed. Oyin exhaled slowly, watching the smoke curl into the air. “Busy. Crazy. You probably already know, though.” “Things changed overnight for the store. Temi Otedola wore one of my designs, tagged me, and boom suddenly, Oyin is one of the biggest luxury brands in Lagos.” Mike raised a brow, clearly impressed. “Look at you. Lagos big girl.” Oyin grinned. “Don’t hate.” “I’m not. I think it’s dope. You always had an eye for this stuff.” Mike leaned back, resting into her, she could feel his breath on her cheeks as he pulled in for a kiss on her forehead. “I’m proud of you, you know, Me one the other hand, you remember Tunde and Jamal?, We’ve been grinding. Been back and forth between Lagos and Joburg for the past year, trying to get everything off the ground.” This she already knew from stalking his page but she had to play it cool, The conversation flowed, dipping in and out of the past, their wins, their struggles. It felt natural. Easy. Like slipping back into something they had both been pretending not to miss. Then Mike’s stomach grumbled loudly, making them both burst into laughter. “You’re still as greedy as ever,” Oyin teased. Mike placed a hand on his chest dramatically, making her bust into laughter. “I take offense. Anyway, what do you want to eat?” “I’m not really hungry,” she said, stretching.”But I will take whatever you have “ Mike smirked, standing up as he head into a kitchen and returned with a tray and two bowls of cut up fruits, two apples and a shiny knife with wooden handle on it, the same knife she had just stabbed him with. The date went sour after they had kissed and Mike broke the kiss to tell her he has something he wants to tell her, He had meant a girl in SA on one of his trips and they have been dating for four months now, how did she miss that, she had checked his socials every night before going to bed as she had made it a ritual but nothing there spoke about a big booty SA stealing her man, she was lost and confused she sat there not knowing what to do, Maybe they were just playing around and now that she’s here he’s going to realize that he loves just her and only her. He moved her close, “I love you still, I will always do, I love her too and to be honest with you I plan on asking her to marry when I get back but seeing you today, God your body has even gotten hotter since we last spoke and Mama I want you, I can’t help it” he said as he moved to kiss her ears She was irritated, did she just hear him right, her just mentioned that he loves her and another woman in the same sentence while still moving on to her, his hands groped her breast, she told him to stop but his grip only got stronger and tighter, maybe it was the weed but his eyes were red and he looked ruthless and in a spilt second she picked the knife on the tray and dug into into his abdomen, his grip loosened as she pulled the knife out, “Fucking bitch, I will kill you” he said as he sank into the couch, and then the anger came back, he led her on, he knew he had a girl and has been telling her he loves her for the past three days, he invited her over so they could discuss things knowing he was going to propose to another girl, he acted cool when she entered and still tried to rape her, she picked up the knife and stabbed him again and again and again till his eyes were closed shut and his body slipped on the floor, she had killed her man, her first victim.

## ACT2: The cover up

She ended up texting the gateman from his phone, telling him that he had to travel as early as 5 AM. She managed to dress him up like he was just sleeping and then drove out of the compound. When she arrived at her house, she parked in her compound. She had a garden where she grew some vegetables. She waited until she was sure her neighbors had gone to work, then called in sick and sent all her domestic staff away, telling them she wanted to be alone. Once the house was empty, she went under the staircase where Kunle, her gateman, kept the shovel. With it in hand, she walked into the garden and started digging between the mango tree and the pineapple plant she had planted last year. It was supposed to mature this year. She dug for hours, but the hole still wasn’t deep enough. She knew she had to act fast—her colleague, Chisom, who lived just a street away, would likely stop by after work. She had snuck the remaining blunt she and Mike were smoking into her bag earlier. Needing a break, she went back inside to take a few drags, then returned to the garden, this time determined to finish the job. She set a thirty-minute timer and dug furiously. By the time the alarm rang, she had a big enough hole, deep enough to fit Mike’s muscular body. Dragging his body from the house, she could swear he felt heavier than he had earlier. With a final shove, she kicked him into the hole and covered him up. She had bought some fruit seeds from her flower shop two months ago but never had the time to plant them due to work and managing her store. Now, she finally had the chance. She leveled the ground and planted the seeds at the sides. It was the perfect cover—no one would notice anything different since she never allowed her workers into the garden. It had always been her safe space. Once done, she picked up the tools, closed the garden gate, and went inside. She stepped into the shower to wash off the dirt, and that was when reality hit her—she had just killed a man. Worse, she still had the murder weapon, his phone, and his passport with her. She hurried out of the bathroom and checked the time. It was only 1:45 PM, but it felt like a lifetime had passed. Grabbing his phone and the knife wrapped in a scarf, she got into her car. She needed to get rid of them immediately. The best way she could think of was to throw them off the Third Mainland Bridge. Driving out of her apartment in Ikeja, she headed straight for the same bridge she had crossed earlier, this time without Mike’s lifeless body in her car. But before disposing of the evidence, she stopped by her favorite restaurant and ordered a large meal—her first of the day. Sitting in the parking lot, she devoured the food. After eating, she picked up Mike’s phone and saw multiple messages from his friends, all wondering why he had missed their morning meeting. Using the password she had seen him enter the night before, she unlocked the phone and texted them back, claiming he had flown back to Joburg to propose to Bethany that night. Then, she removed the SIM card, snapped it in half, and placed the phone in her bag before driving to the beach. Luckily, it was 3 PM on a Thursday, and the beach was almost empty. Taking a long walk along the shore, she ensured no one was watching before throwing the knife into the water—without the scarf. She also tossed the broken SIM card and left his phone behind. Finally, she sat down and allowed herself to cry for the first time since yesterday. Less than twenty minutes later, she got back into her car and headed home. She should have destroyed the phone completely, but dumping all the evidence in one place was too risky, so she had to hold onto it for now. As she entered the Maryland traffic, her phone rang. It was Chisom. She answered, and Chisom told her she was packing up to leave work and would be stopping by for their usual tea and to hear about her visit to Mike yesterday. She also asked if she wanted anything. Oyin told her she was hungry and asked her to pick up three wraps of amala with goat meat and ewedu soup from their favorite restaurant. Chisom teased her about having such a big appetite despite being sick. That was when she noticed it too—despite the heavy meal earlier, she was still starving. When she got home, she texted Chisom to also pick up some weed on her way. Then, she walked into the kitchen, took Mike’s phone, placed it into the mortar her mom had sent her, and pounded it with all her strength until all that remained were scraps of metal and plastic. She packed the pieces into a Ziploc bag and hid it inside an empty shoebox in her room. Feeling like she still had blood on her body, she ran herself a bath and soaked in the tub. Surprisingly, it was peaceful. There was no bloody image of Mike haunting her. She felt eerily calm. She was woken up by the sound of Chisom’s car horn blaring outside. Grabbing her robe, she hurried downstairs to open the gate. By this time, she was so hungry that she could swear her stomach was growling. Chisom, convinced that Mike had broken her heart again, suspected that was why she had called in sick and suddenly wanted weed. She wanted the full gist. Oyin played along, telling her that Mike had admitted he had a girlfriend, and she had to understand and walk away. She just needed time to take it all in. She ate her food, licking every last bit of soup from the plate, before picking up the blunt Chisom had rolled. As she inhaled, Chisom reminded her that she was lucky to have Friday and the weekend to pull herself together because she had to appear in court on Monday for the final hearing of an important case. Winning it would bring her a step closer to making partner. Dragging in another breath of smoke, she realized she needed to get her act together. Otherwise, she would go from being a lawyer to being convicted of murder. Still hungry, she asked Chisom if she wanted pizza for dinner. Chisom was confused by her sudden appetite but dismissed it as heartbreak mixed with munchies from the weed. Dinner arrived: a large pizza with eight chicken wings, garlic bread, and a medium-sized pizza on the side. Chisom watched, stunned, as Oyin devoured the entire big box by herself. The fact that her fitness-obsessed friend had just eaten three wraps of amala and a large pizza in under two hours worried her. She assumed it was just heartbreak and left her alone. Before leaving that night, Chisom gave Oyin a big hug and kissed her forehead, promising to check in again tomorrow on her way to work. THE MURDER Standing in the same garden, she gazed at the flowers—tall, vibrant, thriving. They were feeding well. The spot where Mike lay beneath them had become the most fertile in her yard. Five months had passed, and her pineapple was finally ripe. A lot had happened since that night, but the craziest part? She had gotten away with murder. By the following Monday, his face was on a missing persons poster. She had been at the firm then, celebrating a major case win, pretending to be the concerned ex. That part was easy. What wasn’t easy was keeping tabs on the investigation, waiting to see if the walls would close in. The search had lost momentum now. His last known location? Johannesburg. A convenient misdirection. She had been thorough. His passport? Burned, the ashes flushed down the drain. The final piece of evidence, erased. Well, almost. She had kept the shattered scraps of his phone—a souvenir, a reminder. Tonight, she had company. After several dates, her new man was coming over for the first time. She plucked the pineapple and handed it to her housekeeper. "Cut it up, keep it chilled," she instructed. It would be a perfect treat to offer him later. Before heading back inside, she took one last look at the flowers and smiled to herself. She was no longer the weak, orphaned girl clawing her way to the top of one of the biggest law firms. No longer the woman still haunted by the ghost of her first love. She was a murderer. And the scariest part? No one knew. Mike’s body remained buried beneath the flowers, his grave hiding in plain sight.
